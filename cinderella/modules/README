Very short introduction on how to write a module for cinderella:

You need to create a file with the class TcpModule. This class must
implement at least one method, namely "evaluate", which has one
parameter, the conversation.

The conversation is an array of strings containing the "conversation"
between server and client. The return value of the evaluate method is
an array with two boolean values, the first element marks whether the
conversation could be fully evaluated, and the second element is the
result of the evaluation.

You can also create other methods and properties, whatever you need.

An example:

class TcpModule

  def evaluate(conv)
    retval = Array.new
    retval << true # stream is evaluated
    if conv[0] == "foo" then
      retval << true
    else
      retval << false
    end
    retval
  end

end
