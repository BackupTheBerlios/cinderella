How to configure cinderella
===========================

The configuration of cinderella is really easy. One line is one
configuration entry. Empty lines are not allowed. Comments are marked
with a # at the beginning of the configuration entry.

The type of the configuration entry is given in the first column.
Currently valid types are "tcp", "udp" and "icmp" (without quotes).

TCP configuration entries are structured the following way:
tcp <module_to_load> <src_connection_regex> <dst_connection_regex> 

where <module_to_load> is the file that contains the TcpModule that
should evaluate the traffic of every connection from
<src_connection_regex> to <dst_connection_regex>.

The regular expressions describing the host and the connection's source
port is matched against the IP address and the source port of an actual
connection. The same applies for the second regular expression, with the
destination port instead of the source port.

UDP configuration entries are handled the same way, with s/tcp/udp/ig.


ICMP configuration look the following way:
icmp icmpcode1[,icmpcode2,...] <src_ip_regex> <dst_ip_regex>

which means that a host with an IP address matching <src_ip_regex> may
send the ICMP codes given in the icmp code list to an IP address
matching matching <dst_ip_regex>. Valid ICMP codes are:
* echoreply
* unreachable
* sourcequench
* redirect
* echo
* routeradvert
* routersolicit
* timxceed
* paramprob
* tstamp
* tstampreply
* ireq
* ireqreply
* maskreq
* maskreply

Invalid ICMP codes are ignored and a warning message is written to
cinderella's log file (when it's enabled and the log level is WARN or
lower).
